# Awesome Mapbox Web Maps [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> An Awesome List of Web Map Applications built with Mapbox tools and services.  Web Maps included in this list should "stand on their own" as full-featured, publicly-accessible production web applications (not demos or examples)

> The intent of the list is to provide examples of fully-built web mapping applications, demonstrating good UI/UX and design practices, interactions, animations, markers, menus, popups, sidebars, etc.
